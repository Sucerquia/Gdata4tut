# Sith Stretching of Glycine

This repository contains the data generated by sith for a stretching process.

In this repository you will find:

- **G.pdb :** PDB file containing the initial structure for the of the glycine with the NME and ACE capping groups.
- **frozen_dofs.dat :** First line: atoms used for stretching, marked with `F` (here: `1 16 F`). Second line: atoms involved in the rupture (here: `1 5 F`).  
- **Stretched structures: G-stretched<n>.<ext> :** `<n>`: stretching step index (`0` = unconstrained optimization). `<ext>` includes:

    - `.chk`: Gaussian checkpoint file.  
    - `.com`: Gaussian input file (with distance constraints).  
    - `.fchk`: human-readable checkpoint file with final optimized structure.  
    - `.log`: Gaussian log file.  
    - `.xyz`: optimized coordinates.  

- **rupture/:** directory containing files for the cleaved molecule.
- **foces/:** directory with the outcomes of the computation of forces, including the fchk files transformed into sith reader convention.
